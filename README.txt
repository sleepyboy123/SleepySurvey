This is a comprehensive guide on how to set up the SleepySurvey website on a local machine
1) Download and install node (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2) Download git (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3) Open the terminal and clone the repository down from github `git clone https://github.com/sleepyboy123/SleepySurvey.git`
4) Change directory into the terminal `cd SleepySurvey`
5) Install dependencies `npm install`
6) Start website `npm start` (After the initial setup, you can just navigate to the directory and run this command to start the website)
7) Find the IP Address of your host machine. For windows, `ipconfig` For Mac `ifconfig`. You are looking for an IPv4 Address. If there are multiple addresses just try them all. It looks like 172.16.0.126
8) On your test machines, open the browser and go to <IP Address>:3000 (172.16.0.126:3000)

The results are stored on firebase. 
1) Login to gmail using sleepysurvey123@gmail.com and Asdasd123%

4) Click on the sleepysurvey project
5) In the sidebar, click on Develop > Cloud Firestore

This is a guide to set the random values that will be used for the pay feature
1) Go into the SleepySurvey/src Folder
2) Edit the random.js file (This can be done with notepad)
3) Follow the format in the document to add / edit the values
It follows a key value pair e.g "Snickers": 3.45,
It is important to note that the key ("Snickers") has to have the exact same name as the PNG file in the images section
